## Welcome! 👋

This Project is a Technical Assessment for the position of a Full Stack Developer (FrontEnd Specialist) role.
This assessment aims to evaluate my design and UX skills in developing a user-friendly and visually
appealing 2-page form for onboarding startups on the Vester.AI platform (a startup assessment tool).
Please read the instructions below carefully and complete the tasks within the specified time frame.

## Instructions: 

I am required to design a simple 2-page form for onboarding startups onto the
Vester.AI platform. The form should include the following questions:

Form Page 1:
● What is your startup's name?
● What is your startup's website?
● Where in Africa is your company legally registered?

Form Page 2:
● Which of these best describes your industry? (provide dropdown)
● What technology does your company mainly use? (provide dropdown and ability to
select all that apply)
● When was your company founded? (date selection)

## Deploying Project 
This Project was deployed on Vercel and you can access it here :https://vesterai-onboarding-form.vercel.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
