## Welcome! üëã

This Project is a Technical Assessment for the position of a Full Stack Developer (FrontEnd Specialist) role at [Vidare](https://vidare.world/).
This assessment aims to evaluate my design and UX skills in developing a user-friendly and visually
appealing 2-page form for onboarding startups on the Vester.AI platform (a startup assessment tool).
Please read the instructions below carefully and complete the tasks within the specified time frame.

## Instructions: 

I am required to design a simple 2-page form for onboarding startups onto the
Vester.AI platform. The form should include the following questions:

Form Page 1:
- What is your startup's name?
- What is your startup's website?
- Where in Africa is your company legally registered?

Form Page 2:
- Which of these best describes your industry? (provide dropdown)
- What technology does your company mainly use? (provide dropdown and ability to
select all that apply)
- When was your company founded? (date selection)
